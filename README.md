                      Danny's Diner Case Study  (https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/)
Introduction

Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: 
sushi, curry, and ramen.Danny’s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat. The restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of 
operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

Problem Statement

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent, and which menu items are 
their favorite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalized experience for his loyal customers.He plans on using these 
insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program. Additionally, he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily 
inspect the data without needing to use SQL.Danny has provided a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues, but he hopes that these examples are enough for you
to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!
